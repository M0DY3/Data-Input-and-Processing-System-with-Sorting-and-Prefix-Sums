# Data-Input-and-Processing-System-with-Sorting-and-Prefix-Sums

[+] This project involves the development of a user-friendly system for managing and processing data. Users can customize the number of items to be entered and specify the length of Names and Numbers. The system enforces data integrity by allowing entry of either Names (comprising only letters) or Numbers (comprising only digits), disallowing any mixed entries.

[+] Upon entering the desired number of items and the length specifications, the system returns to the main menu (OpenMenu). Users can revisit this section by selecting option 1 to modify the previously entered data or choose option 2 to enter the actual items.

[+] During the item entry phase, the system prompts users to input data for each Name or Number individually, maintaining clarity in the process. Each data entry is recorded in a separate row.

[+] Upon completing the item entry, users can return to the OpenMenu, where they have the option to press 1 for modifying the number and length of Names/Numbers, 2 for changing Names/Numbers, or 3/4 to display items either in their original sequence or classified into Names and Numbers.

[+] The system also facilitates Ascending sorting of Names (Option 5) and performs Prefix sums on Numbers (Option 6) if selected in the OpenMenu. The sorting operation is well-known, and for Numbers, the prefix sums are computed as y(i) = x1 + x2 + ... + x(i), where x represents individual Numbers.

[+] Displaying the sorted Names (Option 7) or Prefix sums of Numbers (Option 8) is supported in the system. The results are presented in a format designed for clarity and ease of understanding. Users can navigate back to the main menu by pressing the space bar.

[+] This project ensures a seamless and efficient data management experience, allowing users to tailor their data input and analysis according to their specific needs."
